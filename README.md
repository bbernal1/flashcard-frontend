This is a pet project to display skills in using Java and Angular to create a fullstack application. I have an interest in learning Japanese and discovered Spaced Repetition applications such as Anki and Memrise which help in learning the language. Therefore, I decided to combine it with my passion for programming and create an application of my own that uses a Spaced Repetition algorithm to help me learn Japanese. This app is primarily for learning purposes and as a result will be constantly changing as my skills in Angular increase.
