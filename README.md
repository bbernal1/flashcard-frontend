### Flashcard Application frontend using Angular
#### This application is hosted at https://jpcards.herokuapp.com
#### The associated backend application can be found at https://github.com/bbernal1/flashcard-backend

This is a pet project to display skills in using Java and Angular to create a fullstack application. I have an interest in learning Japanese and discovered spaced repetition(SRS) flashcard applications such as Anki and Memrise which help in learning the language. Therefore, I decided to create my own SRS flashcard application in order to practice my prgramming skills and relate it to my interest in Japanese language learning.
