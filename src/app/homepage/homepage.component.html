        <p>
          I am currently learning Japanese and I've been using
          Anki(https://apps.ankiweb.net/), a Spaced Repetition App, for helping
          me learn the language. This is a basic flashcard app inspired from
          Anki for making and reviewing flashcards.
        </p>
        <p>
          The flashcards are stored in a mongoDB database and retrieved via a
          Java backend. I am currently working on being able to add flashcards
          to the database via the app(the current cards have been added by
          interacting with mongoDB directly)
        </p>
        <p>
          The flashcards can be graded based on the difficulty so that a due
          date for review can be calculated. I implemented the SM-2 Spaced
          Repetition algorithm for calculation of the due dates. More
          information about the algorithm can be found at
          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo and
          https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/english/ol/sm2
