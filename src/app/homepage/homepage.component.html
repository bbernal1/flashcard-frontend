          I am currently learning Japanese and I've been using Anki(https://apps.ankiweb.net/), a Spaced Repetition App, for helping me learn the language. 
          This is a basic flashcard app inspired from Anki for making and reviewing flashcards. 
        </p><p>The flashcards are stored in a mongoDB database and retrieved via a Java
          backend. I am currently working on being able to add flashcards to the
          database via the app(the current cards have been added by interacting with mongoDB directly)
        </p>
        <p>
          The flashcards can be graded based on the difficulty so that a due date for review can be calculated.
          I implemented the SM-2 Spaced Repetition algorithm for calculation of the due dates. More information about the algorithm can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo and https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/english/ol/sm2
